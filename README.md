- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @MyUlysses on GitHub, Jeremy everywhere else. 
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m a life insurance product manager. I am very interested in data science and exploring creative new ways to use and understand the data that surrounds us.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Spanish with my son. I studied it for a few years in college but am working on being able to actually use it to talk with people. And it's a fun activity for us to do together. 
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: jbottor@wgu.edu
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: he/him/his
- âš¡ Fun fact: My family and I have decided to move to Europe. If you're looking for a data guy, especially one with a life insurance background, maybe we should talk. We're pretty focused on finding a place in Spain, but I could see us being very happy in France.
